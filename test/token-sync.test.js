// TRANSITIONAL — a merge-window escape hatch, NOT a standing exemption.
//
// Adding or changing a shared block always touches both repos, and both
// halves can never merge in the same instant — so for as long as one PR is
// open, this side and the neighbor's `main` are guaranteed to disagree on
// that block (missing marker, or a byte-level mismatch on the parts that
// changed). Without an escape hatch that's a deadlock: this repo's PR fails
// CI until the neighbor's PR merges, and the neighbor's PR fails CI on the
// blocks THIS PR touches until this PR merges.
//
// A block listed here is exempted from both failure modes (missing marker
// on the neighbor, byte-level mismatch) for the duration of that named
// companion PR only. Every entry MUST carry an issue reference — an entry
// without one is a bug, and the file refuses to load if it finds one (see
// the validation loop below). The list MUST be emptied immediately once the
// named companion PR(s) merge (#85 tracked this repo's post-#84 cleanup).
// A non-empty TRANSITIONAL outside of an active cross-repo merge window
// means the guard is silently checking less than it claims to, exactly the
// failure mode #83 was filed to fix in the first place.
//
// Normal state: EMPTY. Populate it only while a companion PR that changes a
// GLP-SHARED block is open on the neighbor repo, and empty it again in the
// same round that companion PR merges — see #85 for the shape that cleanup
// PR takes.
